## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Accomplishments

* **Fully Automated Workflow:** Engineered a time-triggered data collection pipeline using GitHub Actions that runs on a daily schedule, ensuring consistent and up-to-date data.
* **Robust Data Ingestion:** Developed a resilient Python script for data extraction, transformation, and cleansing, featuring error handling and randomized user-agents to ensure high availability.
* **Secure Cloud Integration:** Architected a secure credential management system using GitHub Secrets and Google Cloud Service Accounts, eliminating the need for hardcoded keys and adhering to security best practices.
* **Scalable Data Storage:** Designed a two-part data storage solution within Google Sheets, featuring a "live" daily data table and a triggered archival system for building a clean, historical time-series database.
* **API-Driven Logic:** Built and deployed a secure webhook using Google Apps Script, allowing the Python backend to programmatically trigger data archival actions within the Google Workspace ecosystem.
